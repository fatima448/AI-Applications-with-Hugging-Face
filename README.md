# AI Applications with Hugging Face

## 🤖 Overview
This repository contains multiple AI mini-projects built using
**Hugging Face models and tools**.  
Each project explores a different application of pre-trained
natural language processing (NLP) models.

The goal of this repository is to experiment with Hugging Face
pipelines, understand how transformer-based models work, and build
practical AI applications.
